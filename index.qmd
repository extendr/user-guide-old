# Introduction

The extendr suite of software packages provides a set of utilities for bridging
the R and Rust programming languages, making it easier for users to pass data
between them using automatically generated bindings. In so doing, it overcomes a
fundamental challenge of all such language bindings, namely, the fact that the
two languages make different design choices regarding the representation of data
types. Most of the time, data types in Rust and R map quite nicely. In other
cases, it takes careful consideration. And, in a few unfortunate cases, it is
not even possible. Generally speaking, though, if an R version of a Rust type
exists, extendr will do that mapping for you, but you will on occasion have to
do some of that work yourself.

To help guide you toward best practices here, we have put together this website
as a *user* guide, with lots of examples showcasing all things extendr, Rust,
and R, as well as the confluence of all three.
